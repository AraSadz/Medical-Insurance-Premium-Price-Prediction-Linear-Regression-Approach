Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has been carried out to prepare a nice and suitable dataset to be 
employed for machine learning (ML) approaches.

Various methods to design linear regression models have been explored in this notebook. 

A final model is obtained for the prediction of the premium price using the available features in the dataset.

The parameters of the final model is tunned systematically.
